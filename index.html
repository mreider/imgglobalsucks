<h1>IMG Global Sucks!</h1>
<p>This is a chronicle of why IMG Global sucks. I'll start with my story and then include other stories I found on Reddit, Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>My Story</p>
<p>In 2021 I went to California with my family. I bought travel insurance from IMG Global. During my trip I felt some chest pain and asked a doctor what to do. He asked me some questions,
  and told me to go to the ER. Off I went.</p>
<p>2 years later I got a call from a Swiss collection saying I owe $7,000 to the California hospital. I called IMG Global and they said they denied my claim as the hospital report said I
  felt symptoms two weeks prior to my trip (pre-existing condition). It's true, I felt something in Austria, but it was more pronounced in California, and thus my doc told me to go to the ER.
  If it felt serious enough before my trip - I would have gone to the ER in Austria! So the argument makes no sense. Especially considering the ER in Austria is FREE.</p>

  <p>The bill is $7,000 for a EKG and some blood work. Criminal!</p>
