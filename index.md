**Background**

In 2021 I went to California with my family. I bought travel insurance from IMG Global. During my trip I felt some chest pain and asked a doctor what to do. He took my blood pressure, asked some questions, and told me to go to the ER. Off I went.

The hospital submitted the claim to IMG Global. I assumed everything went fine from there. But I discovered recently that IMG Global denied my claim in April of 2022 and never informed me about it. I called them this week and they said the hospital report shows I felt symptoms one day before my insurance plan started. But is this true?

Two days before my plan started (July 21st) I was in Austria. If I had felt chest pain, I would have visited a doctor in Vienna, where medical care is free and efficient. On the day the plan started (July 23rd) I was in the United States, and my plan had started. This is when my chest pain was noticeably worrying.

The hospital report shows that I said I had chest pain "two weeks ago." But this was a casual estimation, and more likely stated as "about two weeks ago." An exact answer would have been eleven days, not fourteen. 

**Update: Nov 4, 2023**

After sending emails and letters to the physician who treated me, I received a statement from him that "two weeks" was likely an estimate. After sending this to IMG Global, they responded that the statement cannot be included in my file if it is not definitive. In other words, they need the physician to say exactly when my condition began, even though he cannot. He agrees that what he wrote may have been an estimate, but he can't say for sure.

It makes no sense.

- Q: Why would I wait to go to a hospital if the symptoms were the same?
- A: I wouldn't have. The symptoms were more worrisome, so I went.
  
- Q: Why would I have waited to be in the U.S. when healthcare in Austria is free?
- A: I wouldn't have. Obviously the symptoms started in the U.S., which was 11 days, not two weeks.

Infuritating.

Don't use IMG Global. They are a waste of time and money. They are stingy, distrustful, and always looking for an out.
