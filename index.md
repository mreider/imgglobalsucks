Here's my experience with IMG Global Insurance.

## Timeline

1. My family and I planned a trip from Austria, where we live, to the USA, where we're from.
2. I paid for IMG Medical's Patriot Plan (June 2021) to cover medical emergencies.
3. I never received the policy paperwork, though I asked multiple times.
4. I visited the USA and felt chest pain.
5. I sent an email asking if an EKG was covered. They never responded.
6. I visited John Muir Hospital upon a doctor's recommendation.
7. I found out via a debt collector, almost two years later, they rejected the claim.
8. The claim was rejected for pre-existing conditions - but the medical record says this is false.
9. They rejected my dispute, again, for the same reasons.
10. The letter of rejection just states over, and over, that it's a pre-existing condition.
11. The medical records show it is NOT a pre-existing condition.
12. Last week I visited my doctor who signed an official letter stating as much.
13. Now I would like to find a local lawyer, in Indianapolis, where IMG is based, to fight this.

## Details

Despite my paying almost $500 for a month's worth of insurance, my legitimate healthcare needs were not covered because of so-called pre-existing conditions. Yet the dates do not line up. All of the paperwork shows this very clearly. The symptoms began as the policy began. Not earlier.
