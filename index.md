**Vienna, Austria**

This week I received troubling news from a debt collector based in Switzerland. It seems I owe John Muir Medical over $7,000 for a hospital visit that IMG Global will not cover.

Here's the full story:

In 2021 I went to California with my family. I bought travel insurance from IMG Global. During my trip I felt some chest pain and asked a doctor what to do. He took my blood pressure, asked some questions, and told me to go to the ER. Off I went.

The hospital submitted the claim to IMG Global. I assumed everything went fine from there. But it looks like IMG Global denied my claim and never informed me about it. I called them this week and they said the hospital report shows I felt symptoms two weeks prior to my trip, which makes this a pre-existing condition. It's true, I felt something in Austria, but it was more pronounced in California, which led me to the doctor, and the referral to the ER. 

If the condition was serious in Austria, I would have gone to the ER in Austria, where healthcare is great, efficient, and free.

I will update the website as I hear more news, and also include excerpts of other people's problems with IMG Global [like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/u6f62q/do_not_use_img_globals_health_insurance_its/).

Stay tuned.
