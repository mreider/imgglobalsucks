**Sep 21, 2023**

**Vienna, Austria**


In 2021 I went to California with my family. I bought travel insurance from IMG Global. During my trip I felt some chest pain and asked a doctor what to do. He took my blood pressure, asked some questions, and told me to go to the ER. Off I went.

The hospital submitted the claim to IMG Global. I assumed everything went fine from there. But I discovered recently that IMG Global denied my claim in April of 2022 and never informed me about it. I called them this week and they said the hospital report shows I felt symptoms one day before my insurance plan started. But is this true?

Two days before my plan started (July 21st) I was in Austria. If I had felt chest pain, I would have visited a doctor in Vienna, where medical care is free and efficient. On the day the plan started (July 23rd) I was in the United States, and my plan had started. This is when I started noticing chest pain. 

The hospital report shows that I said I had chest pain "two weeks ago." But this was a casual estimation, and more likely stated as "about two weeks ago." An exact answer would have been eleven days, not fourteen. 

I will update the website as I hear more news, and also include excerpts of other people's problems with IMG Global [like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/u6f62q/do_not_use_img_globals_health_insurance_its/).

Stay tuned.
